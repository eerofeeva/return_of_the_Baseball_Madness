2013-2015 Baseball playoff appearances vs. Concession prices

â€¢ We hypothesize that teams who win a lot and have bigger stadiums/are in larger metro areas will have lower cost of food and drink in their stadiums. Teams with few wins, smaller stadiums, and smaller metro areas will have higher prices.

	o Teams that made it to the playoffs in 2013-2015:
		- Stadium size/capacity
		- City population where stadium is located
		- Beer prices
		- Team performance (number of times in the playoffs, possibly more time permitting)

	o Data collected from kaggle, data.world, US Census, and a fourth potential data set on average number of tickets sold is being researched
